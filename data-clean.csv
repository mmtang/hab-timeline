Based on the laboratory results and the low levels of toxins detected in the water samples collected from the Tahoe Keys Main Lagoons (Homeowners Lagoons), there is a potential health risk to human and animal health (domestic pets) if water (impacted by the harmful algal bloom) is ingested. The Statewide Guidance on Cyanobacteria and Harmful Algal Blooms recommends the following for waters impacted harmful cyanobacteria:•	You can swim in this water, but stay away from algae and scum in the water•	Keep children away from the algae in the water or on the shore•	Limit or avoid eating fish from these areas; if fish are consumed, remove the guts and liver, and rinse filets in clean drinking water.•	Do not let pets and other animals go into or drink the water, or eat scum on the shore•	Do not drink, cook or wash dishes with untreated surface water from these areas under any circumstances; common water purification techniques such as camping filters, tablets and boiling do not remove toxins.•	Get medical treatment immediately if you think that you, your pet, or livestock has gotten sick after contacting or ingesting water containing blue-green algae. Be sure to alert the medical professional to the possible contact with blue-green algae. Also, make sure to contact the local county public health department.For more information regarding this harmful algal bloom, please contact the Lahontan Water Board at 530-542-5400 or Mary Wagner, lead staff, at (530) 542-5425.On 8/19/17: Regional Water Board was contacted by concerned citizens regarding potential Harmful Algal Bloom in Tahoe Keys Lagoon.

The treatments were in direct response to the HAB earlier in the year.  As shown by the lab results, for 2 consecutive weeks, the HAB and associated toxin have been reduced to an acceptable level.  Additionally, we have taken steps to use biological controls in the lakes to screen nutrients from the water in order to reduce the food source for the algae.  This will be our long-term approach going forward, both as a measure of control against a re-appearance of a HAB, but also as a programmatic approach to enhance water quality in the lakes to improve the environment for all of the organisms.

Those tests found that there did not appear to be conditions that would contribute to poor water quality, such as an algae bloom. Current levels of algae in the water do not seem “uncommon” and are not expected to poorly affect the surrounding wildlife and ecosystem, officials said.
